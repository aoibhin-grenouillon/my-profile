			<h2>Traveling 🌍</h2>
			<p>
				If my friends had to describe me with one particular hobby, it would most certainly be traveling. I visisted 25 countries with my mot recent travl being in Israel in Palestine. In the summer of 2022, with my 2 best friends, we went on a 5 week long roadtrip 🚗 across the United States along the East and West coast🗺. We therefore decided to create an Instagram account to document and share our travels ! Next destination is Lisbonne in August 2023 !

			<h2>Cars 🏎</h2>
			<p>
				I have always had a deep passion for cars, and it is something that I share with my dad. We have been collecting cars for as long as I can remember, and we love nothing more than spending our weekends repairing and tinkering with them. One of our favorite traditions is going to cars and coffee on Sunday mornings, where we get to show off our latest projects and admire the work of other car enthusiasts. I also have a special connection to cars because I learned how to drive on a red MG A from the 1960s, which my dad restored for me 🚘. Our shared love for cars has brought us closer together, and I cherish the memories we have made through our shared passion. This passion for cars gave me the idea to pitch a development project to the french brand Alpine about expanding their business in the United States. If everything works out, I will hopefully be working with them in September

			<h2>Horse Riding 🐴</h2>
			<p> 
				I have always had a deep love for horse riding that I share with my family who owns horses.I could ride before I could even walk. There is something about being around these majestic animals that brings me a sense of peace and calmness. My favorite disciplines are cross country and show jumping, which really gets my adrenaline pumping 🏇. I dream of owning a horse of my own someday, and I can't wait to experience the joy of having a horse at home.
